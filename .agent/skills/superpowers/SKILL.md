# Using Superpowers

Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action. Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means you should invoke it.

## The Rule
1. **Might any skill apply?** If yes, invoke it.
2. **Follow exactly**: Don't rationalize your way out of discipline.
3. **Announce**: "I'm using [skill] to [purpose]".

## Priority
1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging).
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design).
