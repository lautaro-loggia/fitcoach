# Design Principles Reference

## Core Rules
- **4px Grid**: All spacing and padding values must be multiples of 4px.
- **Symmetry**: Padding must be symmetrical (balanced) unless there is a structural reason.
- **Monospace for Data**: Use monospace fonts for IDs, timestamps, and numerical data.
- **Color with Intent**: Gray is for structure; colors are for actions, status, or identity.

## Elevation & Depth
- **Borders-only**: Preferred for dense, technical tools.
- **Subtle Shadows**: For approachable SaaS products.
- **One Strategy**: Don't mix shadows and borders for elevation in the same context.

## Navigation
- Sidebars should have a clear identity (signature).
- Use subtle hover states to indicate interactivity.
