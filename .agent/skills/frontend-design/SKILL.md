# Frontend Design

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop".

## Design Thinking
1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist, retro-futuristic, editorial, etc.
3. **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

## Aesthetics Guidelines
- **Typography**: Choose beautiful, unique, and characterful fonts. Avoid Arial/Inter. Pair a display font with a refined body font.
- **Color**: Commit to a cohesive, bold palette. Use CSS variables.
- **Motion**: Prioritize high-impact moments (staggered load reveals).
- **Backgrounds**: Use atmosphere (mesh gradients, noise textures, grain) over solid colors.

## Never Use
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds.
- Predictable Inter/Roboto fonts.
- Cookie-cutter component patterns.
